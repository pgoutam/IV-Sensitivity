## Introduction 

This notebook explores sensitivity analysis for instrumental variables (IV) analysis. It is based on [this](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/REST_a_00139) paper by Conley and co-authors and the excellent stata package `plausexog` written by Damian Clarke and Benjamin Matta (with accompanying [paper](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0538))   

The basic approach can be stated as follows: all IV models critically rely on the **exclusion restriction** i.e. the instrument only affects the outcome through the endogenous variable of interest. In conducting analysis using observational data, we often run into situations where such a strong restriction is unlikely to hold. Conley et al. (2012) show approaches to conducting inference under relaxations of this requirement. 

To put things a little more formally and borrowing notation from the Conley paper, we have: 
\[
\begin{eqnarray}
  X & = & Z\Pi + V\\
  Y & = & X\beta + Z\gamma + \varepsilon\\
\end{eqnarray}
\]

The first equation is the usual first-stage relationship between the endogenous regression $X$ and the instrument $Z$. The second equation is the usual structural relationship between the outcome $Y$ and endogenous regressor $X$, with the presence of the instrument of the instrument $Z$. The usual exclusion restriction translates to $\gamma\equiv0$. 

But what if we were to relax that and assume a violation of the exclusion restriction? This translates to $\gamma\neq0$ and the term $Z\gamma$ does not drop out of the structural equation. What this means is that our instrument now has a direct effect on our outcome variable. The next section outlines one inference approach presented by Conley and co-authors to deal with this.
